# Security Report Analysis

## High Severity Findings

### Clear-text logging of sensitive information
**Description**: Logging sensitive information without encryption or hashing exposes data to attackers.  
**Affected Files**:  
- `/config.py` (Line 15)  

**Recommendation**:  
- Encrypt or hash sensitive data before logging.  
- Use a secure logging mechanism that avoids storing raw credentials or secrets.  

---

## Medium Severity Findings

### Use of insecure hashing algorithms for password storage
**Description**: Weak algorithms like SHA1 and MD5 are vulnerable to brute-force attacks.  
**Affected Files**:  
1. `/auth.py` (Line 35): Uses **SHA1** for password hashing.  
2. `/crypto.py` (Line 6): Uses **MD5** for password hashing.  

**Recommendation**:  
- Replace with secure, computationally intensive algorithms like **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, or **Argon2**.  
- Ensure password hashing includes salt values.

## Notes
- The report file initially had formatting issues (empty or missing header), but the findings above were extracted and structured for clarity.  
- Always validate third-party libraries for cryptographic functions to avoid deprecated or insecure implementations.
