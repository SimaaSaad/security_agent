Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a CSV report of security findings and wants me to generate a Python script that addresses these issues. First, I need to understand each of the findings listed.

The first finding is about clear-text logging of sensitive information in config.py. The issue here is that sensitive data is being logged without encryption or hashing. The line mentioned is 15, so I need to look at that line. The example shows that the log statement is logging something like "secret" directly. The solution here would be to either remove the logging of sensitive data entirely or, if necessary, log it in an encrypted or hashed form. But since logging sensitive data is generally a bad practice, maybe the best approach is to remove the sensitive data from the log message.

The second and third findings are about using weak hashing algorithms (SHA1 and MD5) for password hashing in auth.py and crypto.py. Both SHA1 and MD5 are considered insecure for password hashing because they're too fast and vulnerable to brute-force attacks. The correct approach here is to replace them with a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt, or PBKDF2. In Python, the recommended library is bcrypt via the 'bcrypt' package. So, wherever they're using hashlib with SHA1 or MD5 for passwords, we need to switch to bcrypt.

Now, I need to write a Python script that can automatically find and fix these issues. Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with the first issue in config.py. The script needs to find the line where sensitive data is being logged. The example shows a log statement like logging.info("Secret: %s" % secret). To fix this, the script should remove the sensitive data from the log message. But how to detect that? Maybe look for log statements that include variables that are marked as sensitive. However, without more context, perhaps the script can search for log statements that include variables that are named in a way that suggests they contain sensitive data (like 'secret', 'password', etc.), but that might be too broad. Alternatively, the script can look for the exact pattern mentioned in the report. The report says the problematic line is at line 15 in config.py, so maybe the script can target that specific line. But since the user wants a general solution, perhaps the script should search for log statements that include variables that are considered sensitive and replace them with a placeholder or remove them.

Wait, but the user's example shows that the sensitive data is being logged directly. So the script should find instances where sensitive data variables are passed to a logging function and modify those lines. For example, in config.py, line 15 might have something like:

logging.info("Secret value: %s", secret)

The fix would be to either remove the variable from the log or replace it with a hashed version. However, the report says to avoid clear-text logging, so the best fix is to remove the sensitive data from the log. So the script would need to find such log statements and modify them to not include the sensitive data.

Next, the second and third issues are about using SHA1 and MD5 for password hashing. The code in auth.py and crypto.py uses hashlib's sha1 or md5. The fix is to replace those with bcrypt. So, wherever there's a call like hashlib.sha1(password).hexdigest(), it should be replaced with bcrypt.hashpw().

But how does the script detect that? The script would need to find instances where hashlib's sha1 or md5 is used on a password variable and replace it with bcrypt. However, the exact code structure might vary, so the script needs to look for patterns like:

hashlib.sha1(password).hexdigest()

and replace it with bcrypt's equivalent. But bcrypt requires a salt and proper handling, so the script would need to generate a salt and use bcrypt.hashpw with a proper rounds parameter.

Wait, but modifying existing code to use bcrypt requires more than just a simple find-and-replace. The script would need to import bcrypt, generate a salt, and adjust the code accordingly. Since this is a script to automate fixes, it should handle these changes programmatically.

Putting this together, the script should:

1. For config.py:
   - Find the line where sensitive data is logged (line 15 in the example).
   - Modify the log statement to remove the sensitive data part.

2. For auth.py and crypto.py:
   - Find instances where hashlib.sha1 or hashlib.md5 is used for password hashing.
   - Replace those with bcrypt.hashpw, ensuring proper salt generation and usage.

But how to implement this in Python? The script will need to read each file, parse the lines, find the problematic patterns, and replace them. Let's outline the steps for each file.

Starting with config.py:

The problematic line is line 15. The example shows that the log statement includes the secret variable. The script can read the file, go to line 15, and modify the log statement. For example, if the line is:

logging.info("Secret: %s", secret)

The fixed line would be:

logging.info("Secret: [REDACTED]")

Or remove the variable entirely, but that might break functionality. Alternatively, the script could comment out the line or replace the variable with a placeholder. Since the report says to avoid clear-text logging, the best approach is to remove the sensitive data from the log. So the script would need to find the variable in the log statement and replace it with a placeholder or remove it.

However, doing this programmatically requires pattern matching. Maybe using regular expressions to find log statements that include variables named like 'secret' or 'password' and modify them. But that's a bit vague. Alternatively, since the report gives exact line numbers, the script can target those lines specifically. But the user probably wants a general solution, not just for the exact lines in the example.

Alternatively, the script can look for log statements that include variables that are considered sensitive. For example, if the variable is named 'secret' or 'password', the script can replace those in log messages. But this might be too simplistic. Maybe the better approach is to look for log statements that include variables that are passed in a way that exposes their values, and replace them with a redacted version.

Moving on to the hashing functions. For the auth.py and crypto.py files, the script needs to find instances where hashlib.sha1 or hashlib.md5 is used on a password variable and replace them with bcrypt.

First, the script needs to import bcrypt. So, the script should add an import statement at the top of the file: import bcrypt.

Then, wherever there's a line like:

hashed = hashlib.sha1(password).encode()).hexdigest()

It should be replaced with:

salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), salt)

But the exact code might vary. The script would need to find the lines where the insecure hashing is done and replace them with bcrypt's method.

However, automating this requires careful regex patterns to match the insecure hashing calls and replace them with the secure ones. Also, the script must handle different ways the hashing functions might be called.

Another consideration is that the script should be idempotent and not break existing code. It should also handle edge cases, like if the password variable is stored in a different way.

Putting this into code:

The script will process each file mentioned in the CSV report. Let's parse the CSV first. The CSV has entries with the file path, line number, and description. The script can read the CSV, iterate over each finding, and apply the necessary fixes.

Wait, the user provided the report in CSV format, so the script can read that CSV to know which files and lines to modify. That makes sense. So the script will process each row in the CSV, determine the type of issue, and apply the fix.

First, the script will need to read the CSV input. Let's see the CSV structure:

Each line has fields like:

Issue,Description,Severity,Message,FilePath,Line, etc.

Looking at the first row:

Clear-text logging of sensitive information,...,/config.py,15,11,15,16

The FilePath is /config.py, and the line number is 15. The message mentions that the sensitive data is logged as clear text. So the script needs to modify line 15 in config.py to remove the sensitive data from the log.

The second and third rows are about using SHA1 and MD5 in auth.py and crypto.py. The lines there are 35 and 6 respectively.

So the script can process each row, check the issue type, and apply the corresponding fix.

Let's outline the steps for each issue type:

1. Clear-text logging:
   - Find the log statement on the specified line.
   - Remove the sensitive data part from the log message.
   - For example, if the line is logging.info("Secret: %s", secret), change it to logging.info("Secret: [REDACTED]") or remove the variable.

2. Weak hashing algorithms (SHA1/MD5):
   - Find the line where the insecure hashing is done.
   - Replace the hashing function with bcrypt.
   - Also, ensure that bcrypt is imported at the top of the file.

But how to do this programmatically?

For the first issue (clear-text logging):

The script would open the config.py file, read the lines, go to line 15 (0-based or 1-based?), adjust accordingly. Let's assume line numbers are 1-based. So line 15 is the 15th line.

The line in question is logging the sensitive data. The script needs to modify that line to remove the sensitive part. For example, if the line is:

logging.info("Secret value: %s", secret)

The script can replace this with:

logging.info("Secret value: [REDACTED]")

But how to detect the variable being logged? Maybe the regex can look for log statements that include a variable that's considered sensitive. Alternatively, since the report specifies the exact line, the script can directly edit that line.

But the problem is that the script needs to be generic. The user might have other instances, so perhaps the script should look for patterns in the code.

Alternatively, given the CSV input, the script can directly target the line number provided. For example, in config.py line 15, replace the sensitive data part.

But the exact code structure might vary. Maybe the line has a format string with a variable. The script can look for the line, find the part where the sensitive variable is passed, and replace it with a placeholder.

Alternatively, the safest way is to have the script read the line, find the part where the sensitive data is logged, and remove it. For example, if the line is:

logging.info("Secret: %s", secret)

The script can replace this with:

logging.info("Secret: [REDACTED]")

But how to do that with regex? Maybe using a regex to match the log statement and remove the variable part.

Alternatively, the script can split the line into the format string and the arguments, and remove the arguments related to sensitive data. But this might be complex.

Alternatively, since the report indicates that the sensitive data is being logged, the script can replace the line with a version that doesn't include the variable. For example, changing the line to log a generic message without the actual data.

Moving on to the hashing issues:

For the SHA1 and MD5 usages, the script needs to find the lines where those functions are used for password hashing and replace them with bcrypt.

For example, in auth.py line 35, the code might be:

hashed_password = hashlib.sha1(password.encode()).hexdigest()

The script should replace this with:

salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), salt)

But also, the script needs to import bcrypt at the top of the file. So the script must add an import statement for bcrypt at the top of the file where it's used.

So steps for the hashing fixes:

1. For each file (auth.py and crypto.py), based on the CSV entries):

   a. Check if 'bcrypt' is imported. If not, add 'import bcrypt' at the top.

   b. Find the line where the insecure hashing is done (line 35 in auth.py, line 6 in crypto.py).

   c. Replace the SHA1/MD5 call with bcrypt.hashpw with a generated salt.

But how to do this programmatically?

The script can read the file, find the line, and replace the hashing function. For example, replacing 'hashlib.sha1(...)' with 'bcrypt.hashpw(...)'.

But the exact code structure might vary. The regex would need to match the insecure hashing calls.

Alternatively, the script can look for lines that use hashlib.sha1 or hashlib.md5 on a password variable and replace them with bcrypt's method.

But this requires parsing the code to find such instances. Since Python's syntax can vary, this might be tricky. Maybe using a regex to find patterns like:

hashlib\.sha1\((.*?)\)

and replace with bcrypt.hashpw(...), but this could be error-prone.

Alternatively, the script can look for the exact lines given in the CSV (line numbers) and perform a line-based replacement.

Assuming the CSV provides the exact line numbers, the script can directly edit those lines.

But the user might want a general solution, not just for the specific lines. Hmm, but the CSV is the input, so the script can process each entry in the CSV.

Putting this all together, the script will:

- Read the CSV input (provided as input to the script, perhaps via a file or stdin).

- For each row in the CSV:

   - Determine the type of issue (logging or hashing).

   - Depending on the issue type, apply the appropriate fix to the specified file and line.

Now, writing the Python script.

First, the script needs to process each CSV row. Let's see the CSV structure:

The CSV columns are:

Issue,Description,Severity,Message,FilePath,Line, etc.

Looking at the first row:

Issue: Clear-text logging...

FilePath: /config.py

Line: 15 (the line number is the 6th field? Let me check the CSV:

The CSV line:

"Clear-text logging of sensitive information",...,/config.py,15,11,15,16

Wait, the columns are:

Issue, Description, Severity, Message, FilePath, Line (maybe the 5th field?), but the exact columns need to be parsed correctly.

Wait, the CSV line is:

"Clear-text logging of sensitive information",...,/config.py,15,11,15,16

Looking at the fields:

The columns are:

Issue, Description, Severity, Message, FilePath, Line (maybe the 5th field?), but the exact order is important. Let me parse the CSV headers:

The first line of the CSV (assuming the first line is the header) would have headers like:

Issue,Description,Severity,Message,FilePath,Line, etc. But the user's example CSV lines don't have headers, so perhaps the fields are in order as per the first line's data.

Looking at the first CSV line:

The fields are:

Issue: "Clear-text logging of sensitive information"

Description: "Logging sensitive information without encryption or hashing can expose it to an attacker."

Severity: error

Message: This expression logs [["sensitive data (secret)"|"relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40"]] as clear text.

FilePath: /config.py

Then the next fields are line numbers, maybe start_line and end_line.

Wait, the CSV fields after the message might be line numbers. The exact CSV structure is a bit unclear, but the key fields are the FilePath and the line number where the issue occurs.

Assuming that the FilePath is the 5th field (index 4 if zero-based), and the line number is the 6th field (index 5). Let me check the first CSV line:

Split the first line (without the quotes):

Clear-text logging..., error, This expression..., /config.py, 15, 11, 15, 16

Wait, the fields after the message might be line numbers. The line number in the file is probably the 5th field (since the first four are Issue, Description, Severity, Message, then FilePath, then line number. Let me count the fields in the first CSV line:

Split the first line by commas (but considering that some fields are quoted with commas inside, but since it's CSV, we need to parse properly.

Alternatively, the user's CSV lines are structured such that the FilePath is the 5th field, and the line number is the 6th. Let me see:

Looking at the first line's fields:

1. Issue: "Clear-text logging of sensitive information"

2. Description: "Logging sensitive information without encryption or hashing can expose it to an attacker."

3. Severity: error

4. Message: This expression logs [["sensitive data (secret)"|"relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40"]] as clear text.

5. FilePath: /config.py

6. 15 (maybe the line number)

7. 11 (maybe start column?)

8. 15 (end line?)

9. 16 (end column?)

But the exact line number is probably the 6th field (index 5 if zero-based). So for each row, the FilePath is at index 4, and the line number is at index 5.

So the script can parse each row, get the FilePath and line number, then modify that line in the file.

Now, for the first issue (clear-text logging):

The line in config.py at line 15 is the problematic line. The script needs to edit that line to remove the sensitive data from the log.

Assuming the line is something like:

logging.info("Secret: %s", secret)

The script can read the line, find the part where the variable is being logged, and replace it with a placeholder.

Alternatively, the script can replace the entire log statement to not include the variable. For example, changing:

logging.info("Secret: %s", secret)

to:

logging.info("Secret: [REDACTED]")

But this requires knowing the exact format. Since the script can't know the variable name, perhaps the safest way is to replace the log statement's format string and arguments to remove the sensitive part.

Alternatively, the script can remove the variable from the log call. For example, if the log line is:

logging.info("User %s has logged in with password %s", username, password)

The script would need to remove the password part. But without knowing the variable names, this is tricky. Maybe the script can look for log statements that include variables that are marked as sensitive in the report's message.

Alternatively, since the report's message indicates that the sensitive data is being logged, the script can look for the line and remove the variable from the log call.

Alternatively, the script can replace the line with a generic message that doesn't include the sensitive data. For example, changing:

logging.info("Secret value: %s", secret)

to:

logging.info("Secret value: [REDACTED]")

This requires knowing the exact line's content. Since the line number is given, the script can read the line, find the part where the variable is passed, and remove it.

But this requires some regex or string manipulation. For example, if the line is:

logging.info("Message: %s", sensitive_var
