## Summary
3 findings found.

## Findings

### 1. Clear-text logging of sensitive information
- **Description**: Logging sensitive information without encryption or hashing can expose it to an attacker.
- **Severity**: error
- **Affected Code**: File: `/config.py`, Line: 15
- **Mitigation Steps**:
  - Avoid logging sensitive data in clear text. Encrypt or hash sensitive information before logging.

### 2. Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data
- **Description**: Using broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithms can compromise security.  
  **Details**: `["Sensitive data (password)"|...]` is used in a hashing algorithm (SHA1) that is insecure for password hashing, since it is not computationally expensive.
- **Severity**: warning
- **Affected Code**: File: `/auth.py`, Line: 35
- **Mitigation Steps**:
  - Replace SHA1 with a secure password hashing algorithm like **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, or **Argon2**.

### 3. Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data
- **Description**: Using broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithms can compromise security.  
  **Details**: `["Sensitive data (password)"|...]` is used in a hashing algorithm (MD5) that is insecure for password hashing, since it is not computationally expensive.
- **Severity**: warning
- **Affected Code**: File: `/crypto.py`, Line: 6
- **Mitigation Steps**:
  - Replace MD5 with a secure password hashing algorithm like **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, or **Argon2**.
```

### Key Observations:
- **Critical Issue**: Clear-text logging of sensitive data in `/config.py` (Line 15) is an **error** and must be addressed immediately.
- **Weak Algorithms**: Both SHA1 (in `/auth.py`) and MD5 (in `/crypto.py`) are deprecated for password hashing. Replace them with modern algorithms like **bcrypt** or **Argon2**.
- **Impact**: Exposure of sensitive data and vulnerability to brute-force attacks due to weak hashing.

### Recommendations:
1. **Encrypt or hash sensitive data** before logging (e.g., use `hashlib.sha256` with a salt for non-password data).
2. **Upgrade password hashing**: Use `passlib` or Python's `bcrypt` library for secure password storage.
3. **Regular Audits**: Scan code for deprecated cryptographic functions (e.g., `MD5`, `SHA1`) and replace them with secure alternatives.
