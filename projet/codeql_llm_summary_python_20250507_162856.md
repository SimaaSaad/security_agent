**Security Vulnerability Report**  
This report outlines critical security findings identified in the provided codebase. These issues pose significant risks to sensitive data and require immediate attention.

### 1. Clear-text Logging of Sensitive Information  
**Description**: Sensitive data (e.g., secrets, credentials) is logged in plaintext without encryption or hashing.  
**Severity**: `Error` (High Risk)  
**Location**:  
- **File**: `config.py`  
- **Line**: 15 (columns 11–16)  
**Recommendation**:  
- Avoid logging sensitive data directly.  
- If logging is necessary, encrypt or hash the data before logging.  
- Use secure logging libraries designed to handle sensitive information.

### 2. Use of Insecure Hashing Algorithm (SHA1)  
**Description**: The SHA1 algorithm is used for password hashing, which is computationally weak and vulnerable to attacks.  
**Severity**: `Warning` (Medium Risk)  
**Location**:  
- **File**: `auth.py`  
- **Line**: 35 (columns 25–41)  
**Recommendation**:  
- Replace SHA1 with a secure password hashing algorithm like **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, or **PBKDF2**.  
- Ensure the chosen algorithm includes a salt and is configured with appropriate work factors.

### 3. Use of Insecure Hashing Algorithm (MD5)  
**Description**: The MD5 algorithm is used for password hashing, which is outdated and susceptible to collision attacks.  
**Severity**: `Warning` (Medium Risk)  
**Location**:  
- **File**: `crypto.py`  
- **Line**: 6 (columns 16–32)  
**Recommendation**:  
- Replace MD5 with a modern, secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).  
- Audit all instances of MD5 usage and update them to comply with current security standards.

### Summary  
- **Critical Issue**: Clear-text logging of secrets (`config.py`) must be resolved immediately to prevent data exposure.  
- **Medium-Risk Issues**: Weak hashing algorithms (SHA1/MD5) in `auth.py` and `crypto.py` should be upgraded to industry-standard alternatives.  
- **Action Required**:  
  1. Review all logging practices to ensure sensitive data is not stored or transmitted in plaintext.  
  2. Migrate legacy hashing functions to secure, computationally intensive algorithms.  
  3. Conduct a full audit of cryptographic practices across the codebase.  

**Impact**: Failure to address these issues could lead to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.
