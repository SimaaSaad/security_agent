### **Summary of Findings**  
| **Finding** | **Severity** | **File** | **Line** |  
|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|  
| Clear-text logging of sensitive information | Error | `config.py` | 15 |  
| Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data | Warning | `auth.py` | 35 |  
| Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data | Warning | `crypto.py` | 6 |

### **Detailed Findings**  

#### **1. Clear-text logging of sensitive information**  
- **Severity**: Error  
- **Description**: Logging sensitive information (e.g., secrets, credentials) without encryption or hashing exposes data to attackers.  
- **Affected Code**:  
  - **File**: `config.py` (Line 15)  
  - **Issue**: Sensitive data (marked as `secret`) is logged in clear text.  
- **Risk**: Attackers can easily access sensitive data from logs, leading to data breaches.

#### **2. Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm (SHA1)**  
- **Severity**: Warning  
- **Description**: SHA1 is cryptographically broken and insecure for password hashing due to its lack of computational expense.  
- **Affected Code**:  
  - **File**: `auth.py` (Line 35)  
  - **Issue**: Passwords are hashed using SHA1, which is vulnerable to brute-force attacks.  
- **Risk**: Weak hashing allows attackers to crack passwords quickly, compromising user accounts.

#### **3. Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm (MD5)**  
- **Severity**: Warning  
- **Description**: MD5 is cryptographically broken and insecure for password hashing due to its lack of computational expense.  
- **Affected Code**:  
  - **File**: `crypto.py` (Line 6)  
  - **Issue**: Passwords are hashed using MD5, which is vulnerable to collisions and brute-force attacks.  
- **Risk**: Weak hashing allows attackers to reverse passwords or forge hashes, leading to unauthorized access.

### **Recommendations**  
1. **Encrypt Sensitive Logs**:  
   - Replace clear-text logging of sensitive data (e.g., in `config.py`) with encrypted logging mechanisms.  
   - Example: Use libraries like `cryptography` to encrypt log entries before writing them.  

2. **Upgrade Hashing Algorithms**:  
   - Replace SHA1 and MD5 with secure password hashing algorithms like **bcrypt**, **Argon2**, or **scrypt**.  
   - Example: Use `passlib` or Pythonâ€™s `secrets` module for secure password handling.  

3. **Code Review and Audits**:  
   - Conduct a full audit of all cryptographic operations and logging practices.  
   - Ensure all sensitive data is protected with modern, industry-standard algorithms.

### **Conclusion**  
The findings indicate critical and high-risk vulnerabilities in logging and cryptographic practices. Immediate action is required to:  
- Fix clear-text logging to prevent data exposure.  
- Replace weak hashing algorithms (SHA1/MD5) with secure alternatives.  
- Implement a process to regularly review and update cryptographic practices.  

Failure to address these issues could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or regulatory non-compliance.
