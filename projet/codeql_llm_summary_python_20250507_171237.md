**Security Vulnerability Report**  

---

### **Summary**  
Three critical security issues were identified in the provided codebase:  
1. **Clear-text logging of sensitive information** (High Severity).  
2. **Use of insecure hashing algorithms (SHA1 and MD5)** for password storage (Medium Severity).  

---

### **Detailed Findings**  

#### **1. Clear-text logging of sensitive information**  
- **File**: `/config.py`  
- **Location**: Line 15, Columns 11–16  
- **Description**: Sensitive data labeled "secret" is logged in clear text without encryption or hashing.  
- **Severity**: Error (High Risk)  
- **Risk**: Exposed logs could leak secrets (e.g., API keys, credentials) to attackers with access to log files.  

---

#### **2. Use of SHA1 for password hashing**  
- **File**: `/auth.py`  
- **Location**: Line 35, Columns 25–41  
- **Description**: Passwords are hashed using SHA1, which is computationally fast and vulnerable to brute-force attacks.  
- **Severity**: Warning (Medium Risk)  
- **Risk**: Weak hashing allows attackers to crack passwords efficiently using precomputed rainbow tables.  

---

#### **3. Use of MD5 for password hashing**  
- **File**: `/crypto.py`  
- **Location**: Line 6, Columns 16–32  
- **Description**: Passwords are hashed using MD5, which is cryptographically broken and insecure for password storage.  
- **Severity**: Warning (Medium Risk)  
- **Risk**: MD5 collisions and fast computation enable password recovery.

### **Recommendations**  

#### **1. Remediate Clear-text Logging**  
- **Fix**:  
  - Remove sensitive data (e.g., secrets, credentials) from logs entirely.  
  - If logging is necessary, encrypt or redact sensitive fields before logging.  
  - Example: Use a logging library with built-in redaction (e.g., `structlog` with filters).  

#### **2. Replace Weak Hashing Algorithms**  
- **For Passwords**:  
  - Use **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, or **Argon2** instead of SHA1/MD5. These algorithms are designed for password hashing and include computational cost and salting.  
  - Example (bcrypt in Python):  
    ```python  
    import bcrypt  
    password = b"password"  
    hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt())  
    ```  
- **For Non-Password Data**:  
  - Use modern cryptographic hashing algorithms like SHA-256 or SHA-3 if hashing is required for non-security purposes.  

#### **3. Code Review & Audits**  
- Audit all logging functions to ensure sensitive data isn’t exposed.  
- Scan the codebase for deprecated cryptographic functions (e.g., `hashlib.sha1`, `hashlib.md5`).

### **Conclusion**  
- **Immediate Action**: Address the **clear-text logging** issue first, as it exposes secrets directly.  
- **Priority 2**: Migrate password hashing to a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).  
- **Long-term**: Implement a security review process for cryptographic operations and logging practices.
