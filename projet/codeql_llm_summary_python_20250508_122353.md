# Security Audit Report

## Summary of Findings

| Finding | Type | Severity | File | Line | Description |
|---------|------|----------|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Clear-text logging of sensitive information | Error | config.py | 15 | Sensitive data logged without encryption or hashing |
| 2 | Weak Hashing Algorithm (SHA1) | Warning | auth.py | 35 | SHA1 used for password hashing |
| 3 | Weak Hashing Algorithm (MD5) | Warning | crypto.py | 6 | MD5 used for password hashing |

## Detailed Findings

### Finding 1: Clear-text logging of sensitive information
**Severity**: Error  
**Location**: `config.py` (Line 15, Columns 11–16)  
**Description**: Sensitive data (e.g., secrets or credentials) is being logged in clear text. The log entry at line 15 includes unencrypted sensitive information.  
**Mitigation**:  
- Avoid logging sensitive data directly.  
- Use encryption or irreversible hashing (e.g., SHA-256) for non-password data.  
- For passwords, use a secure password-hashing library like `passlib` or `bcrypt`.

### Finding 2: Use of Insecure SHA1 Hashing for Passwords
**Severity**: Warning  
**Location**: `auth.py` (Line 35, Columns 25–41)  
**Description**: The SHA1 algorithm is used to hash passwords. SHA1 is cryptographically broken and lacks computational expense to resist brute-force attacks.  
**Mitigation**:  
- Replace SHA1 with a secure password-hashing algorithm like **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, or **Argon2**.  
- Use libraries such as `bcrypt` (Python) to handle password storage securely.

### Finding 3: Use of Insecure MD5 Hashing for Passwords
**Severity**: Warning  
**Location**: `crypto.py` (Line 6, Columns 16–32)  
**Description**: The MD5 algorithm is used to hash passwords. MD5 is cryptographically broken and trivially reversible, making it unsuitable for password storage.  
**Mitigation**:  
- Replace MD5 with a secure password-hashing algorithm like **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, or **Argon2**.  
- Avoid using MD5 or SHA1 for any security-critical operations.

## Recommendations
1. **For Clear-text Logging**:  
   - Audit all logging statements to ensure sensitive data is not exposed.  
   - Use environment variables or secure vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for secrets.  

2. **For Weak Hashing Algorithms**:  
   - Update all password hashing to use **bcrypt** (e.g., `bcrypt.hashpw()` in Python).  
   - Re-hash existing passwords stored with weak algorithms during user login.  

3. **General Practices**:  
   - Regularly review dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., via `bandit` or `safety`).  
   - Implement a security checklist for code reviews to catch insecure practices early.
