## Summary of Findings

| **Severity** | **Issue** | **File** | **Line** | **Recommendation** |
|--------------|-----------|----------|----------|--------------------|
| Error        | Clear-text logging of sensitive information | `config.py` | 15 | Encrypt or hash sensitive data before logging. |
| Warning      | Use of insecure SHA1 hashing | `auth.py` | 35 | Replace SHA1 with a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). |
| Warning      | Use of insecure MD5 hashing | `crypto.py` | 6 | Replace MD5 with a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). |

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Clear-text logging of sensitive information (Error)
**Description**: Logging sensitive information without encryption or hashing exposes it to attackers.  
**Affected Code**:  
- **File**: `config.py`  
- **Location**: Line 15 (columns 11–16)  
- **Message**:  
  > This expression logs `["sensitive data (secret)"|"relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40"]` as clear text.  

**Recommendation**:  
- Avoid logging sensitive data in plaintext.  
- Use encryption (e.g., AES-256) or a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) before logging.  

---

### 2. Use of Insecure SHA1 Hashing (Warning)
**Description**: SHA1 is vulnerable to collision attacks and unsuitable for password hashing.  
**Affected Code**:  
- **File**: `auth.py`  
- **Location**: Line 35 (columns 25–41)  
- **Message**:  
  > `["Sensitive data (password)"|"relative:///auth.py:33:19:33:26"]` is hashed with SHA1.  

**Recommendation**:  
- Replace SHA1 with a password-hashing algorithm like **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, or **Argon2**.  

---

### 3. Use of Insecure MD5 Hashing (Warning)
**Description**: MD5 is cryptographically broken and unsuitable for password storage.  
**Affected Code**:  
- **File**: `crypto.py`  
- **Location**: Line 6 (columns 16–32)  
- **Message**:  
  > `["Sensitive data (password)"|"relative:///crypto.py:4:19:4:26"]` is hashed with MD5.  

**Recommendation**:  
- Replace MD5 with a password-hashing algorithm like **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, or **Argon2**.  

---

## General Recommendations
1. **Avoid Clear-Text Logging**:  
   - Sensitive data (e.g., secrets, passwords) must never be logged in plaintext.  
   - Use secure logging frameworks that support encryption or redaction.  

2. **Upgrade Cryptographic Algorithms**:  
   - Replace weak algorithms (SHA1, MD5) with modern password-hashing standards (bcrypt, Argon2).  
   - Use libraries like `passlib` for secure password hashing.  

3. **Code Audits**:  
   - Perform regular audits to identify and remediate insecure practices.

## Notes
- The original report file had an error: `[Report file was empty or had no header]`. Verify the integrity of the report generation process.  
- Ensure all sensitive data is handled in compliance with security best practices (e.g., OWASP guidelines).

## Severity Key
- **Error**: Critical issue requiring immediate remediation.  
- **Warning**: Non-critical but recommended for improvement.
