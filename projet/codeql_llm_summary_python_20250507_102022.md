**Explanation:**

1. **Reading the CSV Data:** The script reads the provided CSV content (embedded in the script for demonstration) using Python's `csv` module.

2. **Processing Each Finding:**
   - **Clear-text Logging:** Recommends replacing clear-text logging with a secure hash (SHA-256) to avoid exposing sensitive data.
   - **Weak Hashing Algorithms (SHA1/MD5):** Suggests replacing insecure algorithms with `bcrypt`, a secure password hashing function, and provides installation instructions.

3. **Output:** The script generates a human-readable report with file paths, line numbers, and actionable fixes for each vulnerability.

**Usage Notes:**
- Replace the `csv_content` variable with the actual CSV file path using `open()` for real-world use.
- Ensure the `bcrypt` library is installed via `pip install bcrypt`
