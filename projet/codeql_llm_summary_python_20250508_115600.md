# Security Audit Report

## Summary of Findings

| **Finding** | **Severity** | **Location** | **Description** |
|------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Clear-text logging of sensitive information | Error | `config.py:5` | Sensitive data is logged in clear text without encryption or hashing. |
| Use of insecure SHA1 hashing | Warning | `auth.py:33` | SHA1 is used for password hashing, which is vulnerable to brute-force and collision attacks. |
| Use of insecure MD5 hashing | Warning | `crypto.py:4` | MD5 is used for password hashing, which is cryptographically broken and vulnerable to attacks. |

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Clear-text logging of sensitive information
- **Severity:** Error  
- **Description:** Logging sensitive information (e.g., secrets, credentials) in clear text exposes it to unauthorized access if logs are compromised.  
- **Affected Code:**  
  - File: `config.py` at line 5  
- **Mitigation Steps:**  
  - Encrypt sensitive data before logging.  
  - Use irreversible hashing (e.g., SHA-3) if logging is necessary.  
  - Avoid logging sensitive data whenever possible.

### 2. Use of SHA1 for Password Hashing
- **Severity:** Warning  
- **Description:** SHA1 is a weak cryptographic hash function and is vulnerable to collision attacks. It is unsuitable for password hashing due to its computational efficiency.  
- **Affected Code:**  
  - File: `auth.py` at line 33  
- **Mitigation Steps:**  
  - Replace SHA1 with a password-hashing专用 algorithm like **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, or **Argon2**.  
  - Ensure the chosen algorithm includes a salt and adjustable work factor.

### 3. Use of MD5 for Password Hashing
- **Severity:** Warning  
- **Description:** MD5 is cryptographically broken and vulnerable to preimage and collision attacks. It is unsuitable for password storage.  
- **Affected Code:**  
  - File: `crypto.py` at line 4  
- **Mitigation Steps:**  
  - Replace MD5 with a secure password hashing algorithm like **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, or **Argon2**.

## Recommendations
1. **Encrypt or hash sensitive data** before logging to prevent exposure.  
2. **Migrate all password hashing** to modern algorithms like **bcrypt** or **Argon2**.  
3. **Audit all cryptographic implementations** to ensure compliance with security best practices (e.g., NIST guidelines).  
4. **Regularly update dependencies** to avoid deprecated cryptographic functions.

## Severity Key
- **Error (High Risk):** Immediate action required to prevent data exposure.  
- **Warning (Medium Risk):** Address vulnerabilities to avoid future compromises.  
``` 

This report summarizes the critical and high-risk findings from the audit. Immediate action is required for the clear-text logging issue, while the weak hashing algorithms should be prioritized for remediation.
