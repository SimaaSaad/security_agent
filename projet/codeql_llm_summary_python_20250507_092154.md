Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a CSV report of security findings and wants me to generate a markdown report based on it. First, I need to parse the CSV data correctly. Let me look at the data again.

The CSV entries have fields like the issue name, description, severity, message, file path, and line numbers. The first line is "Clear-text logging of sensitive information" in config.py. The next two are about using weak hashing algorithms (SHA1 and MD5) in auth.py and crypto.py. The last line mentions an empty report file, which I should note but maybe not include in the main findings.

I need to structure the markdown report with a title, summary, and sections for each finding. The user specified to use headers and bullet points. Each finding should have a title, description, affected files with links, severity, and remediation steps.

Wait, the links in the message part have markdown syntax like [["text"|"path"]]. I should parse those to create hyperlinks. For example, in the first entry, the message has [["sensitive data..."]], so I'll need to split those into the text and the path. The paths are relative, so maybe just present them as links using the path as the URL.

The severity levels are error and warning. I should categorize them accordingly. The summary should count the number of errors and warnings. Let me check: there's 1 error and 2 warnings. So the summary would say 1 error and 2 warnings.

For each finding, I'll need to extract the file path and line numbers. The line numbers are given as start and end lines. For example, in the first entry, the line numbers are 15,11 to 15,16. Wait, maybe the format is start_line, start_char, end_line, end_char? The user's data has fields like 15,11,15,16. Hmm, perhaps the line numbers are from 15 to 16? Or maybe it's line 15, columns 11 to 40? The exact formatting might not be critical here; I can present them as line ranges.

Now, for each finding entry, I'll structure it under a heading, then list the affected files with links. The remediation steps should be practical: for clear-text logging, suggest encrypting or hashing. For weak hashes, recommend using bcrypt or similar.

I should also mention the note about the empty report file at the end. The user included that line, so I need to include a note section about it.

Let me outline the structure:

- Title: Security Report Findings
- Summary: Number of issues by severity
- Findings section with each issue as a subsection
- Remediation steps for each finding
- Notes about the empty report

Now, let me start writing the markdown. First, the title and summary. Then, for each finding, parse the data. Let's take the first entry:

Issue: Clear-text logging...
Description: Logging without encryption...
Severity: Error
Files: config.py at line 15. The link would be to the file, maybe using a relative path. The message mentions the data is logged as clear text.

The second and third entries are similar but with SHA1 and MD5 in different files. The remediation for those would suggest using stronger algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.

Wait, the user's example uses "bcrypt or similar secure password hashing libraries". That's good. Also, for clear-text logging, maybe suggest using a secure logging library or encrypting the data before logging.

I need to ensure that each finding's section has the title, description, affected files with hyperlinks, severity, and steps. The links should be formatted correctly. Let me check the message part again. The first message has [["sensitive data (secret)"|"relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40"]]. The text is "sensitive data (secret)", and the path is "relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40". Maybe the path is the file location with line and column info. But in markdown, the link would be just the file path, maybe without the line numbers unless specified. Alternatively, the link could point to the file, and the line numbers can be mentioned in the text.

Alternatively, perhaps the path part is the actual URL, but since it's a relative path, maybe just present the filename and line numbers. The exact formatting might need to be adjusted. The user's example in the problem shows the message as part of the finding, so I can include the message text but format the links properly.

Wait, looking at the first entry's message: "This expression logs [["sensitive data (secret)"|"relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40"]] as clear text." So the link text is "sensitive data (secret)", and the link is "relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40". But in markdown, links are written as [text](url). So I need to parse each of those parts. The "relative:///" might be part of the path, but perhaps it's just the file path with line and column info. Maybe the actual link is "config.py#L5" or similar. But since the user provided the exact strings, I'll format them as links using the given paths.

Alternatively, maybe the "relative:///" is part of the URL scheme, but in markdown, the link would be written as [sensitive data (secret)](relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40). However, that might not be standard. Perhaps it's better to just present the filename and line numbers without the URL, since those might not be clickable unless in a specific environment. Alternatively, just present the file path as a link to the file, and mention the line numbers in the text.

Hmm, maybe the user expects the links to be clickable, so I'll format them as markdown links using the provided paths. Even if the paths are relative, the markdown will handle them as links. So for the first entry, the link would be [sensitive data (secret)](relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40). But maybe the actual path is just "config.py", and the numbers are line/column. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects the link to be just the filename, and the line numbers can be mentioned in the text. Maybe I should extract the filename from the path part. Let me see:

Take the first link's path: "relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40". The actual file is config.py, and the line numbers might be 5, but perhaps the numbers after are columns. Since the user provided that, maybe it's better to present the entire path as the link. Alternatively, just use the filename as the link and mention the line numbers in the message.

Alternatively, the message part is part of the finding's description, so I can include the linked text as a hyperlink pointing to the file. Let me structure each finding's message as part of the description, with the links properly formatted.

Wait, the message field in the CSV entries includes the linked text and path. For example, the first message is: "This expression logs [["sensitive data (secret)"|"relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40"]] as clear text." So the part inside the double brackets is the link. So I need to parse each occurrence of [["text"|"path"]] and convert that into a markdown link [text](path). 

So for each occurrence of that pattern in the message, replace it with a markdown link. That requires some text processing. Since this is a static report, I can manually format those parts. Let me see:

First finding's message: "This expression logs [sensitive data (secret)](relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40) as clear text."

Wait, but in markdown, the link would be written as [text](url). So the message should be parsed to replace the [["text"|"path"]] with [text](path). 

So for each message, I need to process the text to replace those patterns. Let me do that step by step.

First finding's message:

Original message: "This expression logs [["sensitive data (secret)"|"relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40"]] as clear text."

After processing, it becomes: "This expression logs [sensitive data (secret)](relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40) as clear text."

Similarly for the others. The second entry's message has [["Sensitive data (password)"|"relative:///auth.py:33:19:33:26"]] which becomes a link to the auth.py file at that line.

So in the markdown, each of these links will be hyperlinks. The user might be using a tool that can resolve those paths, so keeping them as is is okay.

Now, structuring each finding section:

For each row in the CSV (excluding the last line which is a note), create a section with the issue name as a subheading, then description, affected files (with links), severity, and remediation steps.

Wait, the "affected files" can be listed with the links from the message. Alternatively, the files are already listed in the "file path" column. The message's links might be part of the description. Let me see the CSV columns:

Looking at the CSV headers (though the user mentioned the last line says the report had no header, but the data rows have fields separated by commas. The first line's columns are:

1. Clear-text logging...
2. Description
3. error
4. The message (with the link)
5. /config.py
6. 15,11,15,16 (line numbers?)

Wait, the columns are:

Looking at the first line's fields:

1. Issue name: "Clear-text logging of sensitive information"
2. Description: "Logging sensitive information without encryption or hashing can expose it to an attacker."
3. Severity: error
4. Message: "This expression logs [["sensitive data (secret)"|"relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40"]] as clear text."
5. File path: /config.py
6. 15,11 (start line, start char?), 15,16 (end line, end char?) 

Hmm, the columns after the message might be the line numbers. The file path is in the 5th column, then the next numbers are line positions. Maybe the line number is the first number in the next fields. For example, for the first entry, the line numbers are 15,11,15,16. Perhaps the line is 15, and the characters 11 to 16? Not sure, but maybe just note the line number as 15.

Alternatively, the line numbers are start_line, start_char, end_line, end_char. So for the first entry, the line is 15, but the message's link points to line 5 in config.py (from the path in the link: config.py:5:20:5:40). Wait, the link's path is "relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40". That might be a path with line and column info. Maybe the line number is 5, but the file path is config.py. The line numbers in the CSV's columns (15,11,15,16) might be different. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The user might have provided the line numbers in the message's link, so perhaps the actual line is 5 in config.py, as per the link's path. The CSV's line numbers (15,11, etc.) might be part of the data but perhaps not needed if the link already has the line. Alternatively, maybe the line numbers in the CSV are the line in the file where the issue occurs. But the link's path includes :5:20 etc. which might be line 5, columns 20 to 40. 

This is a bit ambiguous, but to keep it simple, perhaps just present the file path with the line number from the link's path. For example, in the first link's path: "relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40" — the line number is 5, so the affected file would be config.py at line 5. But the CSV's file path is /config.py, and the line numbers in the CSV's columns are 15,11, etc. Maybe the line number in the message's link is more accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the CSV's line numbers are the line in the file, so for the first entry, line 15. But the message's link says line 5. Hmm, conflicting info. Maybe the message's link is more precise, so I'll use that. Alternatively, perhaps the line numbers in the CSV's columns are start_line, start_char, end_line, end_char. So for the first entry, start_line is 15, start_char 11, end_line 15, end_char 16. So the line is 15. But the message's link points to line 5. That's conflicting. Maybe it's a mistake, but I'll proceed with the data as given. Perhaps the line numbers in the message's link are correct, so I'll use those.

Alternatively, maybe the CSV's line numbers are the line in the file, so for the first entry, line 15. But the message's link has line 5. Hmm, maybe it's an error, but I'll proceed with the data as provided. Let me check the first entry's message link path: "relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40". The path is config.py, and the line is 5. So the affected line is 5 in config.py. But the CSV's file path is /config.py, and the line numbers in the CSV's columns (15,11, etc.) might be different. Maybe the line numbers in the message's link are more accurate. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line numbers in the CSV's columns are the line in the file, so for the first entry, line 15. But the message's link points to line 5. This inconsistency is confusing. Since the user provided the data, I'll use the information from the message's links for the affected lines. 

Alternatively, maybe the line numbers in the CSV's columns are the line in the file, so for the first entry, the line is 15. The message's link might have a typo. Since I have to work with the data given, I'll proceed by using the file path and line from the message's link. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line numbers in the CSV's columns are not needed, and the message's link has the correct path. Let me proceed with the message's link's path for the file and line.

Putting it all together, each finding's section would look like:

### Finding 1: Clear-text logging of sensitive information
**Description**: [description text]
**Affected Files**: 
- [config.py line 5](relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40)
**Severity**: Error
**Remediation Steps**: [steps]

Wait, but the message's link includes the path with line info. So the affected files can be listed with the link as provided. 

Alternatively, maybe the affected files are just the file path, and the line numbers can be mentioned in the description. 

Alternatively, in the affected files section, list the file with a link to the specific line. Since the path includes line info, the link can be used as is. 

Now, proceeding to structure each finding:

First finding:

Issue: Clear-text logging...
Description: As per the description field.
Affected files: The link in the message's first part. The message's first link is to config.py line 5 (from the path in the link). The message says "This expression logs [sensitive data...] as clear text." So the affected file is config.py, and the link is to that file's line 5.

Second finding: Use of weak hashing (SHA1 in auth.py:33:19:33:26 → line 33 of auth.py.

Third finding: MD5 in crypto.py:4:19:4:26 → line 4.

So for each finding's affected files, list the file with a link to the specific line. 

Now, putting all together in markdown:

Start with the title, summary, then each finding with the details. The last line in the CSV is "[Report file was empty or had no header]", which is a note, so include that as a note at the end.

Now, let me draft the markdown:

---

# Security Report Findings

## Summary
- **Errors**: 1**
- **Warnings**: 2**

## Findings

### 1. Clear-text logging of sensitive information
**Severity**: Error  
**Description**: Logging sensitive information without encryption or hashing can expose it to an attacker.  
**Affected Files**:  
- [config.py (line 5)](relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40)  

**Remediation Steps**:  
- Avoid logging sensitive data directly.  
- Use encryption or irreversible hashing (e.g., SHA-256) before logging.  

### 2. Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data (auth.py)
**Severity**: Warning  
**Description**: Using broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithms can compromise security.  
**Affected Files**:  
- [auth.py (line 33)](relative:///auth.py:33:19:33:26)  

**Remediation Steps**:  
- Replace SHA-1 with a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.  

### 3. Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data (crypto.py)
**Severity**: Warning  
**Description**: Using broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithms can compromise security.  
**Affected Files**:  
- [crypto.py (line 4)](relative:///crypto.py:4:19:4:26)  

**Remediation Steps**:  
- Replace MD5 with a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.  

## Notes
- The report file had an entry indicating it was empty or had no header. Ensure the report generation process is validated to avoid missing critical findings.

---

Wait, but the third finding's title is the same as the second, so to differentiate, I can add (auth.py) and (crypto.py) in the titles. Also, the second and third entries have the same issue name, so adding the filename in parentheses helps distinguish them.

Also, in the first finding's affected files, the link's path is "relative:///config.py:5:20:5:40". The line is 5, so the link is to that line. The line numbers in the CSV's columns (15,11, etc.) might be redundant, so I'll focus on the message's links.

The summary counts: 1 error and 2 warnings. The last line in the CSV is
